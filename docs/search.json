    "text": "Aside from research, those that know me know that the sport of lacrosse (playing and coaching) is a massive part of my life. So, to show you a little bit of my life outside of data, here’s that life in data viz-form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUW-Madison Club Lacrosse, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUFLA National Championship Final, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU17 Canadian National Field Lacrosse Championship, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a map of the geographic ties I’ve made through lacrosse*:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*There are two key omissions in Australia and Belgium, due to space constraints.\n\nCoaching Placements\nHere is a list of some amazing student-athletes whom I’ve had the pleasure of coaching that went on to compete at the next level:\nCoaching Placements\n\nCristopher Discua (Westhill HS ’25) → Manhattanville University [NCAA DIII]\nJared Boyd (Westhill HS ’24) → University of Bridgeport [NCAA DII]\nJeremiah Saint Valiere (Westhill HS ’23) → Dean College [NCAA DIII]\nJames Leydon (Westhill HS ’23) → Union College [NCAA DIII]\nJack Ladenheim (Dawson College ’23) → Dalhousie University [MUFLL]\nJulia Ibelings (Dawson College ’23) → University of Toronto [OUA]\nAshton Benkwitt (Westhill HS ’22) → Delaware Valley University [NCAA DIII]\nNasir Thornton (Westhill HS ’22) → Norfolk State University [NCL]\n\n*The term “placements” is used very loosely here. The athletes are the ones who put in the work.\n\n\nCoaching CV\nI’m on the (coaching) job market!\nBelow is a brief CV of my coaching/athletic history. Since leaving my previous institution, I’m looking for a new team to coach part time, so if you’re in the market for a coach in the Madison area, feel free to reach out to me at my personal email: johndanielshicks[at]gmail[dot]com"
