# Coaching Placements

Here is a list of some amazing student-athletes whom I've had the pleasure of coaching that went on to compete at the next level:

**Coaching Placements**

  - **Cristopher Discua** (Westhill HS '25) → Manhattanville University [*NCAA DIII*]
  - **Jared Boyd** (Westhill HS '24) → University of Bridgeport [*NCAA DII*]
  - **Jeremiah Saint Valiere** (Westhill HS '23) → Dean College [*NCAA DIII*]
  - **James Leydon** (Westhill HS '23) → Union College [*NCAA DIII*]
  - **Jack Ladenheim** (Dawson College '23) → Dalhousie University [*MUFLL*]
  - **Julia Ibelings** (Dawson College '23) → University of Toronto [*OUA*]
  - **Ashton Benkwitt** (Westhill HS '22) → Delaware Valley University [*NCAA DIII*]
  - **Nasir Thornton** (Westhill HS '22) → Norfolk State University [*NCL*]

*<sub><sup>The term "placements" is used very loosely here. The athletes are the ones who put in the work.</sup></sub>

# Coaching CV

I'm on the (coaching) job market!

Below is a brief CV of my coaching/athletic history. Since leaving my previous institution, I'm looking for a new team to coach part time, so if you're in the market for a coach in the Madison area, feel free to reach out to me at my personal email: **johndanielshicks[at]gmail[dot]com**
