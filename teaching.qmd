Instruction is very important to me and I've had the privilege of working with some fantastic students. Below is my history of teaching to date:

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               tibble,
               gganimate,
               magick,
               gifski,
               png,
               ggtext)

theme_custom = theme_light() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5,face = "bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        strip.background =element_rect(fill="white",color = "black"),
        strip.text = element_text(colour = 'black',face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "bottom")

```

## Student Feedback
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

                    "John has devoted much time and efforts in leading the lab and providing super useful code; he's also welcoming students for asking questions and discussing their own project.  He really fulfilled this job and even went beyond it.",0,1,"POLI 666",
                    "John was a great TA. His knowledge of the course content was exceptional.  He was able to effectively communication complex coding techniques with the class during labs and was always available to answer questions. It was also evident that he is really passionate about causal inference.",0,1,"POLI 666",
                    "Great job, and very helpful! John was very nice, approachable and knowledgeable.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                     "John was really responsive during both individual consultations  and email questions. He was really helpful and labs with him  were super handy for solving homeworks.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                     "John was great! He was incredibly patient and helpful,  and we really appreciated the labs he led.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                    "John is simply the best TA. He's available, smart  and actually knows what he's talking about. Those things are not  given in most TAs.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                    "John was great, given a challenging terrain. I don’t think he should  have been the primary source of coding knowledge for this class, but that was how it was structured, and given that undue responsibility, I thought John did very well. It would have been better to go over more of the homework related coding – for instance, if we could have gone over how to properly do each aspect of the homework after it was graded. But I understand that given the amount of coding material he had to cover,  doing such review wasn’t possible in the time. More feedback on homework’s overall  would have been helpful also.",0,1,"POLI 618",
