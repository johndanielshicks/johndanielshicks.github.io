I've had the privilege of working with some fantastic students. Below is my history of teaching to date:

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               tibble,
               gganimate,
               magick,
               gifski,
               png,
               ggtext)

theme_custom = theme_light() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5,face = "bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        strip.background =element_rect(fill="white",color = "black"),
        strip.text = element_text(colour = 'black',face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "bottom")

# Student Feedback
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

comments <- tribble(~comment,~xcoord,~ycoord,~course,
                    "John has devoted much time and efforts in leading the lab and providing super useful code; he's also welcoming students for asking questions and discussing their own project.  He really fulfilled this job and even went beyond it.",0,1,"POLI 666",
                    "John was a great TA. His knowledge of the course content was exceptional.  He was able to effectively communication complex coding techniques with the class during labs and was always available to answer questions. It was also evident that he is really passionate about causal inference.",0,1,"POLI 666",
                    "Great job, and very helpful! John was very nice, approachable and knowledgeable.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                     "John was really responsive during both individual consultations  and email questions. He was really helpful and labs with him  were super handy for solving homeworks.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                     "John was great! He was incredibly patient and helpful,  and we really appreciated the labs he led.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                    "John is simply the best TA. He's available, smart  and actually knows what he's talking about. Those things are not  given in most TAs.",0,1,"POLI 618",
                    "John was great, given a challenging terrain. I don’t think he should  have been the primary source of coding knowledge for this class, but that was how it was structured, and given that undue responsibility, I thought John did very well. It would have been better to go over more of the homework related coding – for instance, if we could have gone over how to properly do each aspect of the homework after it was graded. But I understand that given the amount of coding material he had to cover,  doing such review wasn’t possible in the time. More feedback on homework’s overall  would have been helpful also.",0,1,"POLI 618",
"John was an excellent TA!",0,1,"POLI 666",
"I appreciated how they were willing to use any possible method to assist, including outside of class material.",0,1,"PS 373",
"Super helpful for individual questions, I never had a problem asked he answered my questions. Also, very
responsive with email.",0,1,"PS 373",
"John always does a great job with being available to the class, as well as explaining core concepts in an
accessible manner. John ensures that the class environment is calm and productive, while still allowing for
student input in discussion time. Overall, John has a great command of the material and was able to apply his
knowledge to our learning experience without it being overwhelming to students who are still learning about
coding.",0,1,"PS 373",
"John was always willing to help! He met with me many times outside of the usual hours to help me out. Not
many TAs would do that!",0,1,"PS 373",
"I really liked his relatable approach and the way that he carried the classroom, it was unlike anything I have
experienced in the most positive way possible. It made me feel really comfortable to ask questions whenever I
was confused.",0,1,"PS 373",
"John was always receptive to students and gave many opportunities for help to be requested and questions to
be asked. I have no concerns about his ability to be a good instructor. This was a tough class for me. Some TAs
make difficult courses even worse, but John did not.",0,1,"PS 373",
"I don't really have any complaints. John is a sincere, respectful, and knowledgeable TA, I would recommend him
as a TA without a second thought.",0,1,"PS 373",
"Great at explaining and challenging students to use critical thinking",0,1,"PS 373",
"He was knowledgable about the subject and open to helping when we asked. He made sure to be available
outside of class too.",0,1,"PS 373",
"He gave feedback that was useful.",0,1,"PS 373",
"He's very knowledgable about the course material and always makes sure that we are on the right path.",0,1,"PS 373",
"Created well structured sections through labs.",0,1,"PS 373",
"He is very kind and very patient when explaining different concepts to us. He is very knowledgable on the topic
and able to present multiple examples to explain the concept to make sure we have a full understanding.",0,1,"PS 373",
"John made a very complicated subject of R manageable to myself and others who have never used R before.
John, as well as the other TA's and Ethan were always willing to go out of their way if anyone was confused or
lost in the class.",0,1,"PS 373",
"The TA presented information well.",0,1,"PS 373",
"Very responsive 24/7",0,1,"PS 348",
"I felt that John taught me more in this class than the professor did. I am not sure if that's just how the course is set up, but John went through multiple examples for every type of question in class, and was able to clarify everything asked of him. Furthermore, he was very accommodating when it came to my schedule and when I needed additional instruction. His feedback on my assignments also helped my fix my mistakes before the midterm.",0,1,"PS 348",
"John was always prepared for discussion and the examples he provided us with were useful for clarity and exam preparation. Really enjoyed coming to section and having my questions answered.",0,1,"PS 348",
"John is a great teacher in many aspects. Not only is he patient, funny, and good at what we are learning, but he is also open to student comments/questions and quick to fix any minor errors he might have made. He always responds quickly and with such detailed explanations that I am genuinely impressed by. It shows that he cares and ensures we know what the grades reflect and how to improve later. Sadly this is my last semester in college, otherwise I would've wanted to take more classes with him as a TA.",0,1,"PS 348",
"I really enjoyed all the section materials that John created with weekly practice problems. Those are extremely helpful in terms of preparing for exams and finishing homework. I almost never need to study extra because we have already gone over the same question/logic, they are easy to understand and digest, thanks to John's hard work. I also liked that he would go over at least one problem with us in class before letting the students explore on their own since that really cleared most of the confusions I had in lecture, which gave me a lot of confidence in answering more mathematical/analytical questions in a social science course.",0,1,"PS 348",
"He got better as we went on- which means he was listening to us and thats the best thing a TA can do, make sure he makes sense to the people learning it.",0,1,"PS 348",
"He was always willing to answer questions and was great at explaining the concepts in the class.",0,1,"PS 348",
"He was always available to answer questions and very patient with questions",0,1,"PS 348",
"John Hicks was very effective at helping students understand concepts and was extremely clear and responsive in his communication.",0,1,"PS 348",
"I have no constructive feedback for John. He is enjoyable to learn from and engages well with the material.",0,1,"PS 348"
