I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin--Madison working on international political economy. My research interests include inequality, global value chains, attitudes towards trade and domestic-side IR, which I study using both observational and experimental tools. Prior to coming to UW, I completed my Master's and BA in Political Science at McGill University.

I'd love to chat about research. Feel free to reach out to me at **john[dot]hicks[at]wisc[dot]edu**.
